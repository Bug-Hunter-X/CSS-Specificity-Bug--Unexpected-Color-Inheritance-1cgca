One solution is to be more mindful of selector specificity when writing your CSS. Use more specific selectors early in your stylesheet and cascade them appropriately. Another way is to use the `!important` flag, but this should be used sparingly, as it can lead to more problems in the long run.

```css
/* Using more specific selectors */
#id .special div {
  color: purple;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#id div {
  color: green;
}

/* Using !important (Use cautiously!)*/
#id div {
  color: green !important;
}
```
