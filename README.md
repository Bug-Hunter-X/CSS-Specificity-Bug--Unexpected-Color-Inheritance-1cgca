This repository demonstrates a tricky CSS specificity issue that can lead to unexpected behavior. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic CSS code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution.  The problem arises from the conflicting specificity of different CSS selectors. The solution involves reorganizing the selectors or using the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged).
