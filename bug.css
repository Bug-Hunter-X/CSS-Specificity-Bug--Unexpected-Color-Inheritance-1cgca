The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#id div {
  color: green;
}

#id .special div {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the last selector (`#id .special div`) has the highest specificity because it uses an ID selector, a class selector, and a type selector.  The color will be purple, as intended. However, unexpected behavior can arise when dealing with complex, nested selectors or a lot of inheritance, which can make it hard to trace.
